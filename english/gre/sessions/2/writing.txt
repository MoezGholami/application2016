every paragraph must have 3 layers: claim + explain + additional support (if necessary)

position:
	I generally agree with this for these reasons: ...
	before conclusion, add a paragraph for preventing over-generalizing, especially for one sided positions. "however..."
		do not forget generally in previous paragraphs.

grammar:
	noun clause:
		* every 'wh' can be clause marker
			use correct marker, do not misplace with questions.
		* other markers: that, if, wether
	can be placed as the subject, but it's cleaner to change it as a sentence:
		eg:
			That she is lazy is obvious.
			It's obvious that she is lazy.
