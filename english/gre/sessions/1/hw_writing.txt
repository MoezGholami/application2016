The author suggests that the College and university education should be free for all students and the government should ensure this. Although free education brings some kind of social welfare, we must see the other side of the coin: it may weaken the university education system and free education at the university level for all people means inefficient use of resources, moreover it may cause some social problems about people jobs and occupations.
If we look at universities like companies, the govermental management can weaken them, it prevents competitions among universities in develloping industrial projects, and even worse the bureaaucracy can completely cripple the universities. Furthermore some universities may want to admit better students and may spend more money and provide a better quality, but the government may follow its policies about what it calls 'discrimination'.
Instead of spending assets of the country for providing free university education for all people, clearly all the people does not need university education but all people need drugs, transport infrastructures, social security and other vital things that only the government can provide. Therfore it is an obvious example of waisting money.
Free university education for all people tempts all people going university, and in contrast to primary education it is not necessary for all people and may be harmful. Lots of exceptional professional workers and technicians can be weak and pedestrian and of course useless university students. It is obvious that in addition to university professors and scientists the society needs workers and technicians.
Nonetheless, the education system needs government attention. Of course the government should have supporting role but not main role, for example it must support researchs about national literature or anthropology including financial support. And also the government is responisble for financial aid for talented prospective university students who cannot efford cost of university education.
We can conclude that education at university level must be supported by the government but not fully financed nor for all people. The government can be as a big brother but should not play the main role, otherwise the quality of education may be deteriorated and we may have some problems about job in the society, moreover the government can contribute people better if allocates resources to other fields instead of spending it for 'free university education for all people'.
