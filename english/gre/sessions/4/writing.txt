paraphrasing:
	to be different from the main topic:
	1. start with passive
	2. position
position:
	one sided: if your point is not even morally, logically wrong, providing reasons will convince it.
	paragraph 3 layer:
		I.	refer to the topic
		II.	explain
		III.	then support (example, scenario, ...)

	you can play with ambiguous terms. you can point this.
		you can exaggerate them. you must pay attention to reason as well, DO NOT FORGET (reject the reason).
