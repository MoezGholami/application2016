The author states that academic performance of students should be main factor for calculating teachers' salaries. Of course it is an important purpose of education system but it cannot be the main factor for calculating teachers' salaries. In addition to teachers' performance, academic performance of students depends on their location, living facilities and other societal conditions. Furthermore, students' performance does not depend on 'one' teacher.
Considering a suburban school; university education will cost so much (financial cost, being apart from family, etc.) that only a few students may want to follow their education. Or a factory which needs lots of technicians and workers tempts all the young people living nearby to start working after secondary education. In both cases only few students follow their higher education even they have the best teacher of the world.
Living facilities are also important, in a slum area it's almost impossible to provide suitable education for students even with professional teachers. When students does not have access to public libraries or when they have to work to financially support their parents and their family, it will not be strange if they leave school.
Sometimes students do not want university education because they do not want, they may want to marry and start farming their father's field and it is their traditional lifestyle. They want to follow their dreams and do what they want and they will enjoy their lives, moreover the society needs farmers and rancheros.
Above all, 'one' teacher is not responsible for academic performance of many students. Students' university educations are result of all their teachers' work, a summation of 'bad' and 'good' teachers' works. We cannot distinguish 'good' and 'bad' teachers based on summation of thier work, if we do so we will encourage 'bad' teachers and discourage 'good' ones.
We can conclude although we must evaluate teachers and encourage or discourage them based on performance, we cannot do this based on their students' higher education performance. Because it depends on many complicated parameters rather than teachers' works. Also it is not possible to determine which teacher (among many teachers) cause students' academic failure.
